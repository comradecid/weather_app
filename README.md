OpenWeatherMap API.

#### My Thoughts
I was thinking personally what would be interesting an different that wasn't "just another weather site".
I made it something I would find useful personally as an avid fly fisherman in the middle of some of
the best fishing in the world, why not incorporate weather, fishing report, and what sort of fly's are
being used at the moment. I also wanted something visually attractive to capture your attention.

I would probably incorporate images for each of the popular destinations that would be visually engaging,
create that sense of desire to get away. I was able to utilize Vue.js to create the dynamic data being
called from the API with a very small amount of code. I used a Bootstrap 4 starter that I use to rapid
prototype and build the basic layout and responsiveness. I would probably like more time to fine to
the responsive layout and how the weather box, as well as the "5 day forecasts" layout better as the screen
gets smaller.

With more time I would definitely revisit the weather icons, maybe get them animated and refine the text a bit
more but all in all I think I'm satisfied with what I came up with in a short amount of time, especially digging
a bit deeper into Vue.js, I'm sure there is a better way to approach the Javascript side of things but this library
seemed to be very light weight and easy to manipulate things quickly.

Lastly I would probably take more time to dig in to the API JSON and give more detail weather info and utilize conditionals
to render icons and other items.
